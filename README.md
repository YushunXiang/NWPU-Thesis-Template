# NPU Undergraduate Thesis LaTeX Template (2023)
This is a LaTeX template for undergraduate students at Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU) who are writing their thesis in 2023.  The template is designed to help students quickly complete their thesis without being bothered by formatting issues.  It has been tested on the overleaf platform using XeLaTeX, but compatibility with other local editors is not guaranteed.

## Features
- Based on the [official NPU thesis format](OfficialTemplate/附件8：本科毕业设计（论文）正文模版.doc).
- Includes pre-defined cover pages, acknowledgment, abstract, table of contents, and bibliography.
- Uses UTF-8 encoding and the xeCJK package for better Chinese language support.
- Configured to conform to the requirements of [NPU's Undergraduate Thesis Guidelines (2023 edition)](https://jiaowu.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1164/8308.htm).
## Usage
- Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
- Upload the template to the [overleaf platform](https://cn.overleaf.com/).
- Compile the document using XeLaTeX.
